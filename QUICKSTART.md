# Quick Start Guide

Get started with Augment Review PR Issue Implementation in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with issues and pull requests
- Augment account with API access
- GitHub repository admin access (to add secrets)

## Step 1: Get Augment Credentials (2 minutes)

### Option A: Using Auggie CLI
```bash
auggie tokens print
```
Copy the JSON after `TOKEN=`

### Option B: From Session File
```bash
cat ~/.augment/session.json
```

You should see something like:
```json
{
  "accessToken": "your-token-here",
  "tenantURL": "https://your-tenant.api.augmentcode.com"
}
```

## Step 2: Add GitHub Secret (1 minute)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `AUGMENT_SESSION_AUTH`
5. Value: Paste the JSON from Step 1
6. Click **Add secret**

## Step 3: Create Workflow File (2 minutes)

Create `.github/workflows/validate-issues.yml`:

```yaml
name: Validate Issue Implementation

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  issues: read

jobs:
  validate-issues:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Validate PR implements referenced issues
    steps:
      - name: Validate Issue Implementation
        uses: augmentcode/issue-review-pr@v0
        with:
          augment_session_auth: ${{ secrets.AUGMENT_SESSION_AUTH }}
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          pull_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          repo_name: ${{ github.repository }}
```

## Step 4: Commit and Push

```bash
git add .github/workflows/validate-issues.yml
git commit -m "feat: add issue implementation validation"
git push
```

## Step 5: Test It Out

1. Create a new issue in your repository (e.g., #123)
2. Add some requirements to the issue description
3. Create a new branch and make some changes
4. Commit with: `git commit -m "fixes #123: implement feature"`
5. Open a pull request
6. Watch the action run and post validation feedback!

## What Happens Next?

The action will:
1. ‚úÖ Extract issue #123 from your commit message
2. ‚úÖ Fetch the issue details from GitHub
3. ‚úÖ Analyze the requirements in the issue
4. ‚úÖ Compare your code changes to the requirements
5. ‚úÖ Post a review comment with validation results

## Example Issue Format

For best results, write issues with clear requirements:

```markdown
## Description
Add user authentication to the application

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register with email and password
- [ ] Users can log in with credentials
- [ ] Users can log out
- [ ] Passwords are hashed before storage
- [ ] Invalid credentials show error message

## Technical Requirements
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Store user data in PostgreSQL
- Add JWT token authentication
```

## Example Commit Messages

Reference issues using these patterns:

```bash
# Simple reference
git commit -m "Add login form (#123)"

# Closing keywords
git commit -m "fixes #123: implement user authentication"
git commit -m "closes #456: add password hashing"
git commit -m "resolves #789: implement logout"

# Multiple issues
git commit -m "fixes #123, closes #456: complete auth system"
```

## Customization

### Add Custom Guidelines

Edit your workflow to include project-specific validation:

```yaml
- name: Validate Issue Implementation
  uses: augmentcode/issue-review-pr@v0
  with:
    augment_session_auth: ${{ secrets.AUGMENT_SESSION_AUTH }}
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    pull_number: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
    repo_name: ${{ github.repository }}
    custom_guidelines: |
      - Ensure all acceptance criteria checkboxes are addressed
      - Verify security requirements are implemented
      - Check that tests are included for new features
```

### Change When It Runs

Only validate specific branches:
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
```

Only validate when labeled:
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled]

jobs:
  validate-issues:
    if: github.event.label.name == 'validate_issues'
    # ... rest of job
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No issues referenced in commit messages"
- Make sure your commits include issue references like `#123` or `fixes #456`
- Check that you're using supported patterns (see examples above)

### "Issue not found or not accessible"
- Verify the issue number exists in your repository
- Check that the issue is not in a different repository
- Ensure the GitHub token has access to read issues

### Action doesn't run
- Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
- Check that the trigger conditions match (e.g., PR opened)
- Look at the Actions tab for error messages

### Authentication errors
- Verify `AUGMENT_SESSION_AUTH` secret is set correctly
- Check that the token hasn't expired
- Try running `auggie tokens print` again to get a fresh token

## Next Steps

- üìñ Read the full [README](README.md) for detailed documentation
- üìù Check out [example workflows](example-workflows/) for more patterns
- üîß Review [PROJECT_SUMMARY](PROJECT_SUMMARY.md) for architecture details
- üí¨ Open an issue if you need help

## Tips for Success

1. **Write Clear Issues**: Include explicit requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Use Checklists**: Checkbox lists in issues work great for validation
3. **Reference Issues**: Always reference issues in commit messages
4. **Review Feedback**: Treat AI suggestions as helpful recommendations
5. **Iterate**: Use üëç/üëé reactions to help improve future validations
